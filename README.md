## Data

Using Apify, I scraped videos from 10 toronto foodie accounts and one keyword query “toronto must try”. I had to be very specific in my search queries and it limited the amount of data I could have gotten. In the end, I acquired ~300 Tiktok videos.

I used the chatGPT API to recognize the locations and incorporate it back into JSON. Then, I used Mapbox's search api to locate the addresses of the mentioned restaurants in the tiktok posts.

## Optimizing Load Times

Initially, the website would lag due to the high number of images being loaded at startup. To combat this, I made sure that the pins within the viewbox were the only images and videos being loaded.

## Future Features
- Interpret subtitiles of videos to get restaurant name or locations. ~50% of the videos were missing a restaurant name and location.
- Categorize and assign appropiate hashtags to pins.
